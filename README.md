This study explores algorithm performance evaluation in the Best Arm Identification problem, aiming to optimally allocate measurement resources for identifying the best arm from unknown distributions with minimal measurements. It specifically investigates modified algorithm versions integrating the Top-Two concept. The research addresses the critical need for achieving a balanced exploitation-exploration trade-off and ensuring robustness to unknown true distributions, essential for dynamic decision-making tasks. And ultimately, the objective is to comprehensively compare these algorithms under diverse conditions, elucidating their strengths, weaknesses, and underlying mechanisms. Structured experiments were conducted to assess algorithm performance across varying parameters, with evaluation based on key metrics. Particularly, the impact of implementing top-two modifications was examined. The analysis revealed varied performance outcomes across scenarios, yet overall enhancement compared to original versions was evident, highlighting the modification's success. Additionally, the modified algorithms displayed robustness to diverse true distributions, affirming their effectiveness.
